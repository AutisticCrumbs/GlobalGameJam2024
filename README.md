# Global Game Jam 2024
### The theme is "Make Me Laugh!"

## Keep Hitting the Button! 100 More to Go!

Use the 'LEFT and RIGHT ARROW KEYS' or 'A and D' to move!
Use 'UP ARROW', 'W', or 'SPACE BAR' to jump!

### Reflection

Making a game purposely humorous is a difficult endevor
to do in my opinion. I started with an idea of pressing
a button while the narrator of the game gets progressively
more and more irritated at you. I found the idea to be 
overused in other games, so I decided to change the
irritation with worry. I found this to make the game
a bit funnier with the narrator getting more stressed
trying to tell the player a good joke.

I hope everyone that played the games during this year's
Global Game Jam had a wonderful time!
